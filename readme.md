### Where To Find Things
- All custom checks that were written by the team are located within team.422.checks/src/customChecks
- Tests for the custom checks are located within team.422.checks/tests
	- Here there is one package for each custom check
		- within the package there are multiple unit and integration tests, as well as a file for system testing (following the naming convention "ClassWith...."), also a .txt file for user testing
- All Jars used are located within the lib folder in the "git" or "CS422" folder
