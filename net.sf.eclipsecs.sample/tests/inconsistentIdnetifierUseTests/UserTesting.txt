User testing was done by my other teammates (Devon, and Jomar) checking out my branch in git,
and running my checks on their own .java files.

While running the InconsistentIdentifierUseCheck on his own files, Jomar found an failure.
This failer occured when a fault was executed within my code. This fault was due to an error,
that I commited. The problem was that variables with a preceding f were being catagorized as camelcase.
In order to fix this problem I changed the order of the if statements within my findIdentifierType method.
Moving precedingF to the top, this would mark functions with the preceding f as such before they were
able to be recognized by the camelcase checker.
